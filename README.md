# Nativity Scene Generator

Hello and welcome to the Nativity Scene Generator.

Please note this will not run straight out of the box due to its need for other assets which are *not* open source and :. must not be comitted to this repo.

Please also note this code is for *fun* and :. does not meet any kind of coding standards, reliability, performance or indeed maintainability objectives. It is a hack.

This was written for short Advent Videos for Youtube.

Getting Started:

1. Get a copy of the assets folder.
2. `virtualenv -p python3 venv` - if on windows, ... do windows
3. `source venv/bin/activate` - if on windows this is uhh `venv\scripts\activate` ?
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python runme.py` - can also do `python runme.py 1` to push to second monitor
